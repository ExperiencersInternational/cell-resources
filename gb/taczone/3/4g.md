# Three 4G TAC Zones

Here's my list of Three 4G TAC zones now. This is by far the worst to deal with, just as a warning (they have way too many zones covering an area sometimes (7 that I've seen personally where I am compared to 1 for the other 3). This was an absolute pain to do honestly with how many zones they have.
