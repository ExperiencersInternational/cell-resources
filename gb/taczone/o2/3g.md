# O2 3G LAC Zones List

I'm just doing this for fun. Categorising this the same way as 4G TACs since the same general stuff applies. Generally this can be used as a guide for RNCs on 3G sites too, since they usually use the 3 digits of the TAC at the end (with the exception of 982 for O2 Boostboxes, 759 for some sites with 21752 LAC, 706 for some sites with 21712 LAC and 46 for some old O2 only sites).
