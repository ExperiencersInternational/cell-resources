# O2 4G/5G TAC Zones List

This is a list of O2 TAC zones for both 4G and 5G cells. This is very experimental and is based off of my own data mostly (which is very limited, so take it with a grain of salt). I've tried to highlight some areas where I have limited data in this list.

I've grouped this into regional TACs (might figure out a better name, most TACs), unwind TACs (O2 unwind in Vodafone host) and business deployment TACs (so like a company has a few O2 micros/DAS systems at one of their sites).
