## Vodafone 4G/5G TAC Zones

A list of 4G and 5G TAC Zones that I've mapped on Vodafone personally with where they cover. Data is again quite limited on these, even more than my O2 list as O2 is my main SIM. Vodafone TACs look similar to O2 ones at first glance but they seem to be generally larger.
