# EE 4G TAC Zones

A list of EE 4G TAC Zones, excluding TACs that end with a 0 (VoLTE only TACs). <!--Also excluding the 1xxxx and 4xxxx TACs because I believe them to be older 4G TACs from what I've mapped, EE seems to be quite consistent with the 2xxxx TACs from my experience but that might just be the places I've been.-->
